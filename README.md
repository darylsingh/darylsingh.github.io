This repository is of me playing around with interactions between google api's , webhosting, big data, and circuit board interactions. 
this is the front end software for a project I am woring on and learning with.
Which a large "fusebox" esk relay switch is used in order to calculate and iterate differnt power usages in a home or room 
and can remeotely shut off parasitic draws of power in order to produce a cleaner effect on the environment 
as well as lower electricity costs.
